# Telecom-Churn

Customer Churn is a burning problem for Telecom companies. In this project, we simulate one such case of customer churn where we work on a data of postpaid customers with a contract. The data has information about the customer usage behavior, contract details and the payment details. The data also indicates which were the customers who canceled their service. Based on this past data, we need to build a model which can predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not.
